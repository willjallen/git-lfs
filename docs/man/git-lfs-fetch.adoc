== NAME

git-lfs-fetch - Download all Git LFS files for a given ref

== SYNOPSIS

`git lfs fetch` [options] [<remote> [<ref>...]]
`git lfs fetch` [options] <remote> --stdin

== DESCRIPTION

Download Git LFS objects at the given refs from the specified remote.
See <<_default_remote>> and <<_default_refs>> for what happens if you don't
specify.

This does not update the working copy.

NOTE: When the `lfs.storagecache` configuration option is set to `false`,
`git lfs fetch` refuses to run because the local object cache is disabled.
Use `git lfs pull` or `git lfs checkout` to stream objects directly into the
working tree in that mode.

== OPTIONS

`-I <paths>`::
`--include=<paths>`::
  Specify lfs.fetchinclude just for this invocation; see
  <<_include_and_exclude>>.
`-X <paths>`::
`--exclude=<paths>`::
  Specify lfs.fetchexclude just for this invocation; see
  <<_include_and_exclude>>.
`--recent`::
  Download objects referenced by recent branches & commits in addition to those
  that would otherwise be downloaded. See <<_recent_changes>>.
`--all`::
  Download all objects that are referenced by any commit reachable from the refs
  provided as arguments. If no refs are provided, then all refs are fetched.
  This is primarily for backup and migration purposes. Cannot be combined with
  --recent or --include/--exclude. Ignores any globally configured include and
  exclude paths to ensure that all objects are downloaded.
`--stdin`::
  Read a list of newline-delimited refs from standard input instead of the
  command line.
`--prune`::
`-p`::
  Prune old and unreferenced objects after fetching, equivalent to running `git
  lfs prune` afterwards. See git-lfs-prune(1) for more details.
`--refetch`::
  Also fetch objects that are already present locally.
`--dry-run`::
`-d`::
  Print what would be fetched, without actually fetching anything.
`--json`::
`-j`::
  Give the output in a stable JSON format for scripts.

== INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE

You can configure Git LFS to only fetch objects to satisfy references in
certain paths of the repo, and/or to exclude certain paths of the repo,
to reduce the time you spend downloading things you do not use.

In your Git configuration or in a `.lfsconfig` file, you may set either
or both of `lfs.fetchinclude` and `lfs.fetchexclude` to comma-separated
lists of paths. If `lfs.fetchinclude` is defined, Git LFS objects will
only be fetched if their path matches one in that list, and if
`lfs.fetchexclude` is defined, Git LFS objects will only be fetched if
their path does not match one in that list. Paths are matched using
wildcard matching as per gitignore(5).

Note that using the command-line options `-I` and `-X` override the
respective configuration settings. Setting either option to an empty
string clears the value.

=== Examples

* `git config lfs.fetchinclude "textures,images/foo*"`
+
This will only fetch objects referenced in paths in the textures folder,
and files called foo* in the images folder
* `git config lfs.fetchinclude "*.jpg,*.png,*.tga"`
+
Only fetch JPG/PNG/TGA files, wherever they are in the repository
* `git config lfs.fetchexclude "media/reallybigfiles"`
+
Don't fetch any LFS objects referenced in the folder
media/reallybigfiles, but fetch everything else
* `git config lfs.fetchinclude "media"`
`git config lfs.fetchexclude "media/excessive"`
+
Only fetch LFS objects in the 'media' folder, but exclude those in one
of its subfolders.

== DEFAULT REMOTE

Without arguments, fetch downloads from the default remote. The default
remote is the same as for `git fetch`, i.e. based on the remote branch
you're tracking first, or origin otherwise.

== DEFAULT REFS

If no refs are given as arguments, the currently checked out ref is
used. In addition, if enabled, recently changed refs and commits are
also included. See <<_recent_changes>> for details.

== RECENT CHANGES

If the `--recent` option is specified, or if the gitconfig option
`lfs.fetchrecentalways` is true, then after the current ref (or those in
the arguments) is fetched, we also search for 'recent' changes to fetch
objects for, so that it's more convenient to checkout or diff those
commits without incurring further downloads.

What changes are considered 'recent' is based on a number of gitconfig
options:

`lfs.fetchrecentrefsdays`::
  If non-zero, includes branches which have
  commits within N days of the current date. Only local refs are included
  unless lfs.fetchrecentremoterefs is true. The default is 7 days.
`lfs.fetchrecentremoterefs`::
  If true, fetches remote refs (for the remote you're fetching) as well as local
  refs in the recent window. This is useful to fetch objects for remote branches
  you might want to check out later. The default is true; if you set this to
  false, fetching for those branches will only occur when you either check them
  out (losing the advantage of fetch --recent), or create a tracking local
  branch separately then fetch again.
`lfs.fetchrecentcommitsdays`::
  In addition to fetching at branches, also fetches changes made within N days
  of the latest commit on the branch. This is useful if you're often reviewing
  recent changes. The default is 0 (no previous changes).
`lfs.fetchrecentalways`::
  Always operate as if --recent was provided on the command line.

== EXAMPLES

* Fetch the LFS objects for the current ref from default remote
+
`git lfs fetch`
* Fetch the LFS objects for the current ref AND recent changes from
default remote
+
`git lfs fetch --recent`
* Fetch the LFS objects for the current ref from a secondary remote
'upstream'
+
`git lfs fetch upstream`
* Fetch all the LFS objects from the default remote that are referenced
by any commit in the `main` and `develop` branches
+
`git lfs fetch --all origin main develop`
* Fetch the LFS objects for a branch from origin
+
`git lfs fetch origin mybranch`
* Fetch the LFS objects for 2 branches and a commit from origin
+
`git lfs fetch origin main mybranch e445b45c1c9c6282614f201b62778e4c0688b5c8`
